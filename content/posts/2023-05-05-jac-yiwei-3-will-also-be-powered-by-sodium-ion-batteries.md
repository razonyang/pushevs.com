The JAC Yiwei 3 is an electric hatchback in the B-segment that will arrive in June with LFP batteries, but a version powered by a sodium-ion battery is already confirmed to arrive at a later date.

 

Let's see some known specs of the initial versions.

 

- **Dimensions**: 4.025 mm (length), 1.770 mm (height) and 1.560 mm (width)
- **Wheelbase**: 2.620 mm
- **Seats**: 5
- **Motor**: 70 and 100 kW
- **Top speed**: 150 km/h
- **Range under CLTC**: 305, 405 and 505 km (600 km version will come later)
- **Battery type**: LFP (LiFePO4) battery by Guoxuan Hi-Tech

 

The price of the initial versions with LFP batteries is expected to start at 100.000 yuan (13.117 euros).

Having 4 battery options adds production complexity, so I expect that later this year there will be only a sodium-ion battery version with around 405 km range and a LFP battery version with around 600 km range. Translated to WLTP this would be around 300 km for the budget version and 450 km for the long range version, which seems to hit the sweet spot.

Sodium-ion batteries can be charged faster than LFP, but since they'll be used in budget versions, I don't know if automakers will fully unleash their power.

 

Anyway, JAC Yiwei 3 will be renamed as EV3 or E30X for exportation. This hatchback will be a direct alternative to electric cars such as the Peugeot e-208 and the Renault ZOE.

 

I expect to see a lot of A and B segment electric cars powered by sodium-ion batteries announced this year. Exciting times.
