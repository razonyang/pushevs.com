After introducing the Dolphin and the Seal, BYD is about to launch another electric car in the Ocean series.

 

The BYD Seagull will be the smallest and cheapest option of the series, with 4 seats and an estimated price between 60.000 and 80.000 yuan (8.451 and 11.268 euros).

 

While there is no confirmation yet, I expect it to have the same [battery options as the Dolphin (30,72 and 44,9 kWh)](/2022/05/18/batteries-of-the-byd-dolphin-in-detail/). If it ever arrives in Europe, it'll be a great alternative to the Dacia Spring.

 

The official presentation in China is expected to take place between June and July this year.

 

By now, I think there's no question that BYD is by far the automaker with the best and most complete lineup of electric vehicles.

 

BYD passenger electric cars:

- BYD Seagull
- BYD Dolphin
- BYD Yuan Plus
- BYD Song Plus EV
- BYD Qin Plus EV
- BYD Seal
- BYD Han EV
- BYD Tang EV
- BYD Sea Lion (coming later this year)

 

Moreover, BYD has electric vehicles for public transportation and commercial trucks in every form and shape imaginable.
