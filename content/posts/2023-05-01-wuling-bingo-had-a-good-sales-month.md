Small cars were very popular in Europe before automakers began to force customers into buying more profitable and bigger cars, such as SUVs and CUVs. Hopefully, the A-segment will become popular again with its electrification.

The BYD Seagull and the Wuling Bingo are great representatives of the electric A-segment, however its champion might come from Chery, since this automaker is the first customer for CATL's sodium-ion batteries. Chery is already the biggest exporter of Chinese passenger cars and a small global electric car powered by a sodium-ion battery will help to reinforce its position.

Am I the only one to think that we need the A-segment to become popular again? Many people still think that electric cars are toys for the rich, and legacy automakers are the ones to blame for this.
