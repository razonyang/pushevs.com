SGMW (SAIC-GM-Wuling) is a joint-venture between GM and SAIC that is producing a truly affordable electric car perfect for the city environment, the Wuling Hong Guang MINI EV.

July was the first full sales month for the electric city car Wuling Hong Guang MINI EV and it was impressive with 7.348 units delivered. Currently more than 15.000 units were already delivered.

Who would've known that good availability and decent price is important for a small electric car's success?!

 

Depending on the version, in China this small electric car has a starting price between 28.800 and 38.800 yuan (3.540 and 4.769 euros).

The secret for the impressive production volume and price achieved by this small electric car has to be its cobalt-free LFP (LiFePO4) batteries. They are safe, durable and extremely affordable. Without rare raw materials, cobalt-free batteries can be produced at extremely high volumes and this truly affordable electric car won't risk having its production constrained by battery supply...

I don't have the specs of most cells used in these four different battery packs, but the 100 Ah cell made by Guoxuan seems to be the "low-cost type", as we can see from the table below.

Moving on... the Wuling Hong Guang MINI EV isn't the only affordable electric car from the SGMW joint-venture, there's also:

**Baojun E300 specs**

- **Length**: 2.625 mm
- **Wheelbase**: 1.750 mm
- **Width**: 1.647 mm
- **Height**: 1.588 mm
- **Weight**: 920-940 kg

**Baojun E300 Plus specs**

- **Length**: 2.894 mm
- **Wheelbase**: 2.020 mm
- **Width**: 1.655 mm
- **Height**: 1.595 mm
- **Weight**: 1.040-1.052 kg
- **Seats**: 4 (2 adults and 2 kids)
- **Motor**: 40 kW (peak) and 150 N.m of torque

- **Battery capacity**: 31,9 kWh
- **Range**: 305 km (NEDC)
- **Starting price**: between 69.800 and 84.800 yuan (8.578 and 10.421 euros)

 

The Baojun E300 is well equipped with modern safety features rare in small and affordable cars, such as:

- Adaptive Cruise Control
- Lane Departure Warning & Assist System
- Intelligent Safety Protection
- Automatic Emergency Braking System
- Auxiliary and Valet Parking System
- Guided Vehicle Anti-theft Warning System

 

The 305 km range in NEDC represents around 229 km in WLTP, making this electric car acceptable for many European customers if sold here for a decent price.

Anyway, looking at the table below we conclude that none of these models are eligible for the full government nationwide subsidies in China. However, they do get a 8.000 yuan (982 euros) subsidy if sold in rural areas and in China every electric car benefits from a sales tax exemption until the end of 2022.

Small affordable electric cars are perfect for commuting during weekdays in crowded cities, relegating bigger and heavier cars (electric or not) for the weekends with the family.

My guess is that the first electric car to hit the one million units sold in a year milestone will be a small affordable electric car with a cobalt-free battery.

If you're wondering, the Hong Guang MINI EV already counts with more than 50.000 orders and the planned production for 2020 (with just six full sales months) is 200.000 units. In 2021 with a full year production I expect at least half million units to be sold...

Would you be interested in one if you could get it for the price of the [Renault Twizy](https://www.renault.fr/vehicules-electriques/twizy/configurateur.html) (10.000 euros)?

Thanks Leo B for the heads up.
