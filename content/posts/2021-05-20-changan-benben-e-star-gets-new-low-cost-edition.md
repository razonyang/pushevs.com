The Changan Benben E-Star is now available in a new low-cost version called National Edition with a starting price of 29.800 yuan (3.792 euros). Yes, you seen it right, it costs less than 4.000 euros and makes the popular Wuling Hong Guang MINI EV look overpriced...

 

The biggest downside of this low-cost edition is that it's based on the old model, the exterior and interior don't look as modern as the refreshed edition, as you can see in the image below.

The National Edition shows us how cheap electric cars can be and seems to be a good alternative to the Wuling Hong Guang MINI EV. The name of this edition suggests that it's only made for the domestic market. Moreover, it's as unsafe as most regular heavy quadricycles, since it doesn't even have airbags...

While more expensive, the refreshed edition seems like a proper A-segment electric car that could be exported to Europe, unfortunately it isn't available with cobalt-free batteries yet.

Anyway, I think that the Changan Benben E-Star refreshed edition looks great, but the [Leapmotor T03 offers much better value for money](/2021/05/14/leapmotor-t03-gets-cheaper-with-lfp-battery/). It has more range (403 km in NEDC) and optional safety features rare in the A-segment, such as ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control), LKA (Lane Keep Assist) and AEB (Automatic Emergency Braking). Another good alternative is the [JAC Sihao E10X.](/2020/11/30/jac-sihao-e10x-unveiled-with-cobalt-free-lfp-battery/)
