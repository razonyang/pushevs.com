In the first quarter of 2022, the global shipment of batteries reached 95,1 GWh, which corresponds to a 93,3 percent increase year-on-year, according to a report released by Seoul-based SNE Research.

 

Let's see who are the top EV battery makers.

 

1. **CATL**: 33,3 GWh (35 %)
2. **LG Energy Solution**: 15,1 GWh (15,9 %)
3. **BYD**: 10,5 GWh (11,9 %)
4. **Panasonic**: 9,4 GWh (9,9 %)
5. **SK On**: 6,3 GWh (6,6 %)
6. **CALB**: 4,2 GWh (4,4 %)
7. **Samsung SDI**: 3,8 %
8. **Gotion High-Tech**: 2,7 %
9. **Svolt Energy**: 1,3 %
10. **Eve Energy**: 1,2 %
11. **Others**: 8,2 %

 

Chinese battery makers have been riding the LFP (LiFePO4) wave to gain market share, while Japanese and Korean makers still don't mass produce cobalt-free EV batteries. However, the Korean companies - LG and SK - are already developing LFP battery cells and could soon announce their mass production...

Panasonic is still suffering for relying on producing almost exclusively cylindrical cells for a sole customer (Tesla) for such long time. Moreover, Toyota that is now using its new prismatic cells only produces as few electric cars as it cans...

As for CATL, the company is definitely determined to stay on the top and will start mass producing sodium-ion batteries in 2023. Combining cobalt-free cells and module-less battery packs now seems to be the recipe for success that some makers are still ignoring.

 

Anyway, one thing is clear, only Asian companies are mass producing EV battery cells. I'm beginning to think that the European Battery Alliance is a joke to make us believe that the European Union is doing something to move away from fossil fuels. Similar to Volkswagen that was for many years the champion of EV press releases, while producing close to nothing.
