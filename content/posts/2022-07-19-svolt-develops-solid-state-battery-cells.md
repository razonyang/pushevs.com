The Chinese battery cell maker SVOLT is now testing solid-state battery cells to power electric cars with range superior to 1.000 km on a single charge.

 

> The cells have an energy density of 350-400 Wh/kg and has now successfully passed tests including pin prick and 200°C hot box tests.

WeLion and Volkswagen-backed Gotion High-tech are also developing solid-state batteries. With a 150 kWh solid-state battery pack the super-efficient NIO ET7 is expected to get a 1.000 km range on a single charge.

 

Anyway, while solid-state has some advantages, such as increased safety and energy density, this battery technology isn't perfect.

Common liquid/gel electrolytes have much higher conductivity than solid electrolytes. This is why solid-state batteries usually charge slower, have poor cycle life and need to operate at much higher temperatures.

However, all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) are constantly improving and according to the [latest research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-021-00952-0), it's already possible to reach 3.000 cycles with 80 % of the capacity left with 4,8 V solid-state battery cells at room temperature.

 

Summing up, until the battery makers disclose the cycle life and operating temperatures of their ASSBs we won't know for sure how good they are.
