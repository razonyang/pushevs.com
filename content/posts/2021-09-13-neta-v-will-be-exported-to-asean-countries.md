The Chinese all-electric car maker Hozon Auto has been developing an English version of its website to prepare the expansion to other markets. Now, the carmaker finally announced that it will produce a right-hand drive version of its affordable electric car NETA V to be exported to ASEAN countries.

 

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) brings together ten Southeast Asian states into one organisation:

 

1. Brunei
2. Cambodia
3. Indonesia
4. Laos
5. Malaysia
6. Myanmar
7. Philippines
8. Singapore
9. Thailand
10. Vietnam

 

In China the NETA V is available in many versions, but the one bellow offers the best value for money.

 

**Long range entertainment version (best value for money version)**

- **Length**: 4.070 mm
- **Wheelbase**: 2.420 mm
- **Width**: 1.690 mm
- **Height**: 1.540 mm
- **Tire specifications**: 185/65 R15
- **Wheels**: aluminium
- **Number of seats**: 5
- **Motor**: 55 kW and 175 N.m of torque
- **Maximum speed**: 100 km/h (firmware limited)
- **DC fast charging**: 30 minutes (30-80 %)
- **On-board charging**: 6-8 h (6,6 kW)
- **Range**: 401 km (NEDC) and around 300 km in WLTP
- **Battery capacity**: 38,54 kWh (LFP battery cells by CATL)
- **Starting price (before subsidies)**: 80.900 yuan (10.426 euros)
- **Starting price (after subsidies)**: 70.900 yuan (9.137 euros)

 

This electric car besides affordable is extremely efficient. It has the same range of a BYD Dolphin or a Renautl ZOE ZE 40 but with a smaller battery capacity, which is impressive.

The [NETA V also has a faster and better equipped version called Co-sport Magic Edition](/2021/06/23/neta-v-co-sport-magic-edition-arrives/) - that would make sense to be exported to more wealthy right-hand drive markets, such as Australia or South Africa.

 

**NETA V Co-sport Magic Edition**

- **Length**: 4.070 mm
- **Wheelbase**: 2.420 mm
- **Width**: 1.690 mm
- **Height**: 1.540 mm
- **Tire specifications**: 185/55 R16
- **Wheels**: aluminium
- **Number of seats**: 5
- **Motor**: 70 kW and 150 N.m of torque
- **Maximum speed**: 120 km/h
- **Acceleration performance**: 3,9 seconds (0-50 km/h)
- **DC fast charging**: 30 minutes (30-80 %)
- **On-board charging**: 6-8 h (6,6 kW)
- **Range**: 401 km (NEDC) and around 300 km in WLTP
- **Starting price (before subsidies)**: 86.900 yuan (11.236 euros)
- **Starting price (after subsidies)**: 76.900 yuan (9.943 euros)

 

Curiously, this new edition comes with V2L (Vehicle-to-Load) capability as standard.

 

Finally, Hozon Auto also announced that next year it'll export its much-awaited premium electric car NETA S to Europe. This electric car was created in cooperation with Huawei.

Anyway, 2022 seems to be the year when good Chinese electric cars start to enter into foreign markets at a higher pace. BYD, Xpeng, NIO, ORA, GAC AION, Leapmotor and Hozon Auto are coming...
