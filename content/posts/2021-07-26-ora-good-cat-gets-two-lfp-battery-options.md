Previously, the ORA Good Cat had a LFP (LiFePO4) battery in the standard range version (401 km), but the long range version (501 km) was only available with a NCM battery.

Fortunately, recent Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) homologation documents show us that a LFP battery will also be available in the long range version.

 

Let's see some details that I managed to extract from MIIT documents.

 

**ORA Good Cat standard range specs (CC7000BJ01GBEV)**

- **Length**: 4.235 mm
- **Width**: 1.825 mm
- **Height**: 1.596 mm
- **Curb weight**: 1.555 kg (empty vehicle)
- **Gross weight**: 1.930 kg (vehicle more passengers and cargo)
- **Maximum speed**: 150 km/h
- **Motor**: 105 kW and 210 N.m of torque
- **Consumption**: 13,8 kWh/100 km in NEDC
- **Range**: 401 km in NEDC and around 300 km in WLTP
- **Battery capacity**: 49,92 kWh (usable) and 51,35 kWh (total)
- **Battery weight**: 394 kg
- **Battery energy density**: 130,33 Wh/kg
- **Battery cell maker**: Guoxuan
- **Battery cell chemistry**: LFP (LiFePO4)
- **On-board charger**: 6,6 kW
- **Fast charging**: 30-80 % in 30 minutes
- **TMS**: liquid-cooling
- **Drag coefficient**: 0,289 Cd

 

**ORA Good Cat long range specs (CC7000BJ02DBEV)**

- **Length**: 4.235 mm
- **Width**: 1.825 mm
- **Height**: 1.596 mm
- **Curb weight**: 1.609 kg (empty vehicle)
- **Gross weight**: 1.984 kg (vehicle more passengers and cargo)
- **Maximum speed**: 150 km/h
- **Motor**: 105 kW and 210 N.m of torque
- **Consumption**: 13,9 kWh/100 km in NEDC
- **Range**: 501 km in NEDC and around 375 km in WLTP
- **Battery capacity**: 57,7 kWh (usable) and 62,95 kWh (total)
- **Battery weight**: 439 kg
- **Battery energy density**: 143,4 Wh/kg
- **Battery cell maker**: SVOLT
- **Battery cell chemistry**: LFP (LiFePO4)
- **On-board charger**: 6,6 kW
- **Fast charging**: 30-80 % in 30 minutes
- **TMS**: liquid-cooling
- **Drag coefficient**: 0,289 Cd

 

The new LFP battery made with cells from SVOLT for the long range version isn't available to order yet. Right now, the long range version with a NCM battery has a starting price after subsidies of 133.900 yuan (17.490 euros). We still don't know if the NCM battery will remain as an option in the long range version, or it will be completely replaced by LFP to cut costs.

Both the affordable EV brand ORA and the battery cell maker SVOLT come from the same parent group GWM (Great Wall Motors).

Anyway, with an energy density of 143,4 Wh/kg, this new LFP battery is more energy dense than some [packs made with NCM battery cells that are currently powering electric cars](/2020/04/04/comparison-of-different-ev-batteries-in-2020/). For example, the battery pack of the Peugeot e-208 - made with NCM 523 battery cells from CATL - has an energy density of 140 Wh/kg.

 

Thanks [Kingun](https://twitter.com/thekingun) for the heads up.
