The solar powered Sion just got its specs upgraded thanks to a new super-safe LFP (LiFePO4) battery with more capacity that provides more range and faster charging.

 

Let's see the press release from Sono Motors.

 

> - **The New 54 kWh LFP Battery Provides the Sion With an Extended Range of up to 305 km and a Maximum Charging Power of up to 75 kW**
> - **More Powerful Battery Eliminates Cobalt, Nickel and Manganese**
> - **In Surveys Over 90% Of Sion Reservation Holders Voted for a Larger Battery**
> 
> **Munich, 24 June 2021 –** After consultation with its Community, Munich-based mobility provider Sono Motors has opted for a more powerful 54 kWh battery for use in the SEV (Solar Electric Vehicle) Sion. The new battery extends the vehicle’s total range by up to 305 km and its maximum charging power by up to 75 kW. The additional range provided by the Sion’s solar panels remains unchanged at a weekly average of 112 km (245 km per week at peak). The new LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery is considered to be one of the safest on the market, and also completely dispenses with the use of cobalt, nickel and manganese.

> “In our survey, more than 90% of our existing reservation holders voted for a more powerful battery,” said Laurin Hahn, CEO of Sono Motors. “This move is just another example of how Sono Motors is continuing to drive innovation and sustainability, whilst responding to the wishes of our Community throughout the development of the Sion. Boasting greater capacity, greater range, faster charging, enhanced safety features and no cobalt, nickel or manganese usage, this improved battery will strengthen the Sion’s unique market position even further,” Hahn continued.
> 
> Key benefits of the enhanced battery include:
> 
> - Extended range of up to 305 km (previously 255 km)
> - No usage of cobalt, nickel and manganese
> - Built with safety in mind and is effectively non-flammable
> - New charging rate of up to 75 kW CCS (previously 50 kW)
> - Increased life span of up to 3,000 cycles, or up to 900,000 km

The energy density of 150 Wh/kg for this LFP battery pack is alright for today's standards. However, already next year [Guoxuan expects to reach 260 Wh/kg at the cell level and 234 Wh/kg at the pack level with its LFP battery cells that have silicon anodes](/2021/01/10/guoxuan-unveils-a-cobalt-free-lfp-pouch-battery-cell-with-212-wh-kg/).

Unfortunately, the Sion doesn't seem very efficient. With a 55 kWh battery the new Renault ZOE gets a WLTP range of 395 km.

 

Anyway, with startups we never know if they really intent to go into mass production or they are just advertising their new technology hoping to sell it to a big company.

After being delayed once again, mass production is now scheduled to begin in 2023. Sadly, every time its arrival gets delayed, the Sion concept becomes less desirable. Notice that the Renault 5 E-TECH is set to debut in 2023 with LFP batteries and a price below 20.000 euros...

 

What do you think? Will we ever see this electric car reach mass production?
