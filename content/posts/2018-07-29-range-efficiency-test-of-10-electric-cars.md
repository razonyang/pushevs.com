The staff of coches.net and AUTOBEST tested the range and efficiency of 10 different electric cars. On the first day the cars were tested by the staff of the coches.net (test 1) and on the second day the cars were tested by the AUTOBEST's staff (test 2). All electric cars were driven until stop from empty battery.

The tests were conducted around Barcelona in highway and city traffic. All electric cars were set to normal mode (no eco or sport modes) and with AC on (set to 19-23º C). The outside temperature varied between 26 and 33º C, perfect to get high mileage.

Furthermore, to safely test how much range these electric cars have left when empty battery warnings show up, the last kilometers were made at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, which is a motorsport race track in Montmeló, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.

 

Let's see the results, from worst to best average range figures.

 

**Hyundai IONIQ Electric (28 kWh)**

- **Range test 1:** 199 km
- **Range test 2:** 224 km
- **Range average:** 212 km
- **Reserve:** 5-8 km
- **Efficiency:** 12,2 kWh/100 km

 

**Kia Soul EV (30 kWh)**

- **Range test 1:** 214 km
- **Range test 2:** 222 km
- **Range average:** 218 km
- **Reserve:** 7 km
- **Efficiency:** 13,6 kWh/100 km

 

**Nissan Leaf (40 kWh)**

- **Range test 1:** 235 km
- **Range test 2:** 220 km
- **Range average:** 228 km
- **Reserve:** 14 km
- **Efficiency:** 16,3 kWh/100 km

 

**BMW i3 (33,3 kWh)**

- **Range test 1:** 225 km
- **Range test 2:** 237 km
- **Range average:** 231 km
- **Reserve:** 30 km
- **Efficiency:** 14,8 kWh/100 km

 

**Volkswagen e-Golf (35,8 kWh)**

- **Range test 1:** 218 km
- **Range test 2:** 244 km
- **Range average:** 231 km
- **Reserve:** 5 km
- **Efficiency:** 12,4 kWh/100 km

 

**Renault  Zoe (41 kWh)**

- **Range test 1:** 273 km
- **Range test 2:** 295 km
- **Range average:** 284 km
- **Reserve:** 15 km
- **Efficiency:** 14,6 kWh/100 km

 

**Jaguar I-PACE (90 kWh)**

- **Range test 1:** 307 km
- **Range test 2:** 319 km
- **Range average:** 313 km
- **Reserve:** 10 km
- **Efficiency:** 27,5 kWh/100 km

 

The Jaguar I-PACE tested belongs to a pre-production series, this could explain the lousy range and efficiency. However, don't expect miracles from software tweaks, this is a heavy and un-aerodynamic electric car.

 

**Opel Ampera-e - Chevrolet Bolt EV (60 kWh)**

- **Range test 1:** 379 km
- **Range test 2:** 375 km
- **Range average:** 377 km
- **Reserve:** 30 km
- **Efficiency:** 16,1 kWh/100 km

 

**Tesla Model X 100D (100 kWh)**

- **Range test 1:** 404 km
- **Range test 2:** 395 km
- **Range average:** 400 km
- **Reserve:** 10 km
- **Efficiency:** 23,4 kWh/100 km

 

**Tesla Model S 100D (100 kWh)**

- **Range test 1:** 411 km
- **Range test 2:** 433 km
- **Range average:** 422 km
- **Reserve:** 10 km
- **Efficiency:** 20,6 kWh/100 km

Having 10 different electric cars tested is great, nonetheless, there are two important electric cars missing. The Tesla Model 3 and the Hyundai Kona Electric would definitely win the range challenge with great efficiency figures.

Anyway, it's important to notice that these particular tests were made with EV-range friendly temperatures in Spain. In colder climates the same electric cars would get worse results, especially the ones that don't have heat pumps. Moreover, there are some strange things in the test results, such as the efficiency figures for the Volkswagen e-Golf and the Kia Soul EV having more range than the Hyundai IONIQ Electric.
