BYD introduced the new eBus Blade Platform at the IAA Transportation 2022.

 

> A focal attraction of the stand is the official European reveal of BYD’s new and highly adaptable eBus Blade Platform, incorporating the ultra-safe, and highly durable Blade Battery that is revolutionising battery electric transportation.
> 
> The rigorously tested Blade Battery passes the punishing demands of the Nail Penetration Test, regarded as the ultimate battery safety test. The Blade’s Battery distinctive CTP (cell to pack) technology significantly improves rigidity compared to traditional structures, giving it superior strength. The space-saving design of the Blade Battery, representing a 50% reduction, is inherent to eBus Blade Platform development, enabling increased battery capacity for a longer driving range, while also reducing chassis weight.

It's great to see that BYD keeps improving its public transportation electric vehicles.

Electric buses with their zero local emissions, low running costs, high efficiency and strong regenerative braking are perfect for city driving. Diesel buses should be banned even before diesel passenger cars.
