The MG Mulan (MG4 Electric) is the new best value electric car - to be sold not only in its home country China, but also in Europe, New Zealand, Australia, Mexico, South America and the Middle East.

Curiously, the prismatic battery cells are placed horizontally inside the module-less CTP (cell to pack) battery, which contribute for a thinner pack and more interior space. Moreover, all versions include V2L (vehicle to load).

 

As for safety and driving assistance features, all versions include:

- Active Emergency Braking with Pedestrian and Bicycle Detection
- Lane Keep Assist (LKA) with Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS)
- Traffic Jam Assist (TJA)
- Intelligent Speed Limit Assist with traffic sign recognition
- Intelligent High Beam Assist
- Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
- Driver Attention Alert

 

I would like a smaller wheels (15 inch) option for better efficiency/range and a 22 kW on-board charger.

 

Anyway, in Europe, the good looking MG4 Electric will be a cheaper alternative to popular electric cars such as the Volkswagen ID.3, Renault ZOE and Peugeot e-208.

However, we shouldn't forget the [BYD Dolphin (Atto 2)](/2021/08/13/byd-dolphin-is-now-available-to-pre-order/) that also aims to become an affordable global electric car, and while smaller, has similar wheelbase and space for passengers. It has the potential to become the ultimate best value electric car. We just need to wait for the upcoming [2022 Paris Motor Show](/2022/07/28/byd-will-be-present-at-the-2022-paris-motor-show/) to know more details about its arrival in Europe.
