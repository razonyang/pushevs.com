The Dacia Spring in France can be pre-ordered from 20 March for first deliveries to start in autumn. The Confort Plus version combined with the DC fast charging option seems to be the best package and in most European countries will cost around 15.000 euros after government subsidies.

 

Anyway, the more expensive Renault Twingo Electric with its WLTP range of 190 km is currently the most direct alternative to the Dacia Spring. It seems that the Renault Group will easily dominate the affordable electric car segment in Europe since all other European automakers despise this segment.

This strategy of the Renault Group will definitely make it more appealing to younger generations, that like electric cars but don't want or can spend much money on a car. Car sharing and rental services will also welcome the rise of this emerging segment.

Nonetheless, Chinese automakers eventually will also try to be successful in this segment, [especially with the arrival of electric cars from ORA with LFP batteries to Europe](/2020/10/12/ora-is-getting-closer-to-its-goal/).
