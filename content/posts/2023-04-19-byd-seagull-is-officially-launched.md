With the Seagull, BYD wants to dominate the electric A-segment market, first in China, then other countries.

 

Let's see some details of this small electric car.

- **Rear parking sensors**: 3
- **Reversing camera system**: standard

- **Vehicle warranty**: Lifetime warranty for the electric system (first owner), and the warranty period for the whole vehicle is 6 years or 150.000 kilometers

 

**Safety equipment (optional in the high level version)**

- Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
- Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)
- Lane Departure Warning (LDW)
- Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR)
- Intelligent Speed ​​Limit Alarm (ISLI)
- Forward Collision Warning (FCW)

 

**Starting prices**

- **Entry level version**: 78.800 yuan (10.445 euros)
- **Mid level version**: 83.800 yuan (11.108 euros)
- **High level version**: 95.800 yuan (12.699 euros)

 

The BYD Seagull shares much of its equipment with the Dolphin and the e2 - that are also part of the Ocean series. The lifetime warranty is probably referring to a 3 in 1 electric system, which includes the motor, motor control unit (MCU/inverter) and the gearbox, but it isn't clear from the translation of the Chinese website.

 

Anyway, if the high level version comes to Europe for the same price of the Dacia Spring, it will have no problem dominating the A-segment market. The BYD Seagull is an awesome small electric car.

What do you think?
