Just before this year's Geneva International Motor Show, PEUGEOT e-208 has its official specs announced.

The PEUGEOT e-208 and its cousin Opel e-Corsa are just two of several much-awaited electric superminis coming to Europe this year. They'll be direct alternatives to other electric superminis such as Renault ZOE 2.0 and Volkswagen ID 3 (Neo).

 

Let's see the highlights:

- 100 kW (136 bhp) electric motor developing 260 Nm of torque
- 0 to 100 km/h in 8,1 seconds in Sport Mode
- 50 kWh battery is guaranteed for 8 years or 160.000 km (100.000 miles) for 70 % of its charge capacity
- The battery is linked to the passenger compartment cooling system, fluid-cooled temperature control enables fast recharging, optimised range and increased life-span
- 340 km (211 miles) range in WLTP and 450 km (280 miles) in NEDC
- 11 kW 3-phase on-board charger
- 100 kW fast charging via CCS allows to charge the battery from 0 to 80 % in 30 minutes
- Heat pump
- Heated seats (according to version)
- Configurable head-up display
- Capacitive 7” or 10" HD colour touchscreen
- 3D digital instrument panel
- MyPeugeot app
- Full LED 3-claw headlight signature (according to version)

 

> "Interior and boot-space are identical to the ICE version. The batteries, which take up a volume of 220L, are distributed under the floor pan in new PEUGEOT 208."

David Peel, Managing Director of PEUGEOT UK said:

> “We are all so excited at PEUGEOT to be building towards our goal of a full electric range by 2023, and the all-new PEUGEOT e-208 is a great step in cementing PEUGEOT’s foothold in the ever-growing EV market.”

 

Finally:

> "The PEUGEOT e-208 will be unveiled at the 2019 Geneva International Motor Show, with an online reservation site opening at the end of March, and opening for orders late summer 2019."

 

Anyway, the PEUGEOT e-208 seems to be a great electric supermini, with 250-300 km of realistic range, 11 kW 3-phase on-board charger and capable of 100 kW DC fast charging via CCS. However, I think that an optional additional 11 kW on-board charger in parallel to reach 22 kW via AC would make it even better.

What do you think about the PEUGEOT e-208? How well do you think it'll sell compared to other alternatives such as the Renault ZOE 2.0 and the Volkswagen ID 3 (Neo)?
