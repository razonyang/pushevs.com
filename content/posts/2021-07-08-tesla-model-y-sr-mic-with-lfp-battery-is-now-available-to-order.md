Chinese customers can now order the Tesla Model Y Standard Range MIC (Made in China) with a starting price of 291.840 yuan (37.995 euros) before governmental incentives.

After subsidies the price drops to 276.000 yuan (35.932 euros), only 10 % higher than Tesla's most-basic Model 3 sedan made in China.

 

First deliveries of this new more affordable version are expected to start next month.

 

**Tesla Model Y SR MIC highlights**

- **Range**: 525 km in CLTC (China light-duty vehicle test cycle)
- **Top speed**: 217 km/h
- **Acceleration**: from 0 to 100 km/h in 5,6 seconds
- **Starting price (before government subsidies)**: 291.840 yuan (37.995 euros)
- **Starting price (after government subsidies)**: 276.000 yuan (35.932 euros)

 

Considering that this should be exactly the same SR version that was recently introduced in Hong Kong, the WLTP range is 455 km.

 

Anyway, Tesla had to introduce this more affordable version, because above 300.000 yuan (39.057 euros) electric cars in China aren't eligible for government subsidies.

 

CATL is now supplying LFP (LiFePO4) battery cells to the two most popular Tesla models.

The giant Chinese battery cell maker hit the jackpot with its super-safe cobalt-free battery cells that don't catch fire or explode even if punctured. This is especially important in China where videos of electric cars burning up appear almost on a daily basis.
