> 
> BYD, the world’s leading manufacturer of New Energy Vehicles (NEVs) and power batteries, announces the presale of the new BYD DOLPHIN. This all-new C-segment hatchback features practicality, efficiency, accessibility and, above all, stress-free travelling as its unique selling points. The BYD DOLPHIN will be available around June / July.
> 
> BYD DOLPHIN is the first model in the Ocean series and the first to adopt the “Ocean Aesthetics” design concept providing a dynamic, stylish, and highly recognisable visual symbol. In the car’s design, the dolphin, a marine mammal, is presented in both figurative and imaginative forms. Dolphin offers a 60 kWh Lithium Iron Phosphate BYD Blade Battery, an exclusive safety body structure for pure electric vehicles, and has a complete range of active and passive safety features, which gives it an incomparable inherent advantage in terms of safety performance. BYD DOLPHIN also features a safe passenger compartment environment, with intelligent driver assistance systems and integrated braking systems to make travel safer and driving more convenient. Like the recently launched BYD ATTO 3, BYD DOLPHIN is also built on e-Platform 3.0.
> 
> ### **Revolutionary Blade Battery as a standard**
> 
> BYD DOLPHIN benefits from the ground-breaking Blade Battery, which is revolutionising safety, durability and performance in the EV industry, and can withstand the harsh punishment of the Nail Penetration Test, regarded as the ‘Mount Everest’ of battery safety tests. BYD DOLPHIN’s cobalt-free Blade Batteries use Lithium Iron-Phosphate (LFP) as its cathode material, which offers a much higher level of safety than conventional lithium-ion batteries. LFP has inherently excellent thermal stability. While being ultra-safe and durable, the Blade Battery is uncompromising in performance, delivering high power density with the benefit of ultra-low energy consumption. This works in close synergy with BYD’s competency in electric powertrain technology. BYD DOLPHIN is, like the BYD ATTO 3, built on BYD’s intelligent e-Platform 3.0 for the ultimate in system efficiency and integrated vehicle intelligence. BYD’s 8-in-1 electric powertrain integrates the Vehicle Control Unit, the Battery Management System, the Power Distribution Unit, the Drive Motor, the Motor Controller, the Transmission, DC-DC, and On-Board Charger. Such deep integration delivers a system efficiency of 89%.
> 
> This integrated technology has been developed to deliver optimum performance and a better driving experience. With the 60 kWh Blade Battery and a permanent magnet synchronous motor, BYD DOLPHIN can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 7 seconds. The 290 Nm of torque and 150kW/204 PS strong motor provide seamless performance helping the Dolphin reach a maximum top speed of 160 km/h. The four driving modes include Sport, Normal, Economy, and Snow modes to suit driving conditions and preferences.
> 
> ### **Reassuring range of 427 km WLTP**
> 
> BYD DOLPHIN has a reassuring WLTP combined electric range of 427 km. Charging power is 11 kW AC 3 phase. High performance is also achieved when it comes to recharging. The 100 kW DC charger can replenish the battery from 30% to 80% in just 29 minutes. BYD DOLPHIN is also equipped with VtoL, so the car battery can easily charge external devices.
> 
> There is also a high-efficiency integrated heat pump as standard on BYD DOLPHIN. The industry’s first direct cooling and heating system for power batteries increases the thermal efficiency by up to 15% in the winter. This innovative system leverages the residual heat from the surroundings, the powertrain, the passenger compartment and even the batteries, and can work at a wide range of temperatures. Intelligent thermal management for extreme weather conditions enables an excellent low-temperature driving range. As a sub-function of the smart brake system, the CRBS coordinated regenerative braking system can efficiently recover the braking energy of the whole vehicle.
> 
> ### **DOLPHIN design: simple and approachable**
> 
> The BYD DOLPHIN design is simple and approachable, as with the rest of the vehicle. BYD DOLPHIN is instantly recognisable and futuristic due to its rounded profile and side silhouette resembling the graceful lines of a leaping dolphin. Based on the Dolphin’s new energy attributes, the short front and rear overhangs and long wheelbase give the car a more spacious appearance. Measuring 4,290 mm long and 1,770 mm wide (with wing mirrors unfolded), the BYD DOLPHIN features a 2,700 mm wheelbase optimised for space and comfort. The vehicle height is 1,570 mm.
> 
> With seating for five occupants, the ergonomically designed sports seats and headrests are made from vegan leather. The heated front seats have a six-way electric adjustment for the driver and a four-way electric adjustment for the front passenger. The rear seats provide generous legroom for passengers, made possible by the e-Platform 3.0. The seats can split 60:40 allowing the 345-litre boot to be expanded to 1,310 litres when both seats are folded flat.
> 
> The seat’s shoulder and back support has been specially optimised, and the side wings are more upright, perfectly fitting the body’s curves for a more comfortable, wraparound ride. BYD DOLPHIN is designed with more than 20 practical and flexible storage spaces for daily travel, and the boot can easily store four standard 20-inch suitcases.
> 
> The BYD DOLPHIN range topping variants feature a large panoramic sunroof made of high-strength acoustic and thermally insulated double-layer grey glazing, with a glass area comparable to that of a D-class luxury car. This provides users with an ultra-wide-angle view, a larger light area, and a more transparent view. It is also equipped with a 97% sunshade to keep you cool on hot summer days.
> 
> The classy interior of the BYD DOLPHIN is designed with smooth, expansive curves to create the illusion that the occupants are wrapped in waves. By placing conventional functions at your fingertips, the dashboard's simple and refined design provides an innovative human-machine interaction experience. Less space is consumed by physical buttons, allowing for more storage space.
> 
> ### **Vehicle-To-Load as a Standard**
> 
> BYD DOLPHIN provides VTOL discharge back technology, which can achieve 3.3kW external discharge, allowing the new energy vehicle to become a mobile power station. This provides convenience for outdoor picnics and open-air movies, allowing multiple lifestyle applications.
> 
> ### **Safety & Driving Assistance**
> 
> The BYD DOLPHIN comes standard with an abundance of safety and advanced driver assistance features. All models feature Forward Collision Warning, Autonomous Emergency Braking, Rear Collision Warning, Rear Cross Traffic Alert and Rear Cross Traffic Brake, Lane Departure Prevention and Emergency Lane Keeping Assist.
> 
> Adaptive Cruise Control and Intelligent Cruise Control add to the enjoyment of driving. The panoramic camera provides the driver with 360-degree visibility for safe vehicle manoeuvring. In addition, a Blind Spot Detection System, Electronic Stability Control, Traction Control, Hill Decent Control, Automatic Vehicle Hold, and Traffic Sign Recognition with Intelligent Speed Limit Control are included as additional driver aids.
> 
> Cutting-edge lighting technology also provides a broader beam of light to assist visibility when driving at night, with High Beam Assist, Adaptive Front Headlights and Follow Me Home as a standard.
> 
> Inspired by the biological characteristics of the BYD DOLPHIN, the design team gave the Dolphin a two-tone body and echoed the colours inside and out to create a sense of exclusivity. The exterior of the BYD DOLPHIN will be available in seven colour combinations.
> 
> More information and exact prices will be announced closer to the official launch of BYD DOLPHIN in June 2023.

Compared to the Chinese version, the European BYD Dolphin is larger, has longer range and a more powerful motor, but the price is disappointing.

With a starting price of 30.000 euros, the BYD Dolphin seems aimed to compete with the MG4 Electric. My opinion is that both models should do well until the new Tesla hatchback eventually dominates this price range. Then there will be a need for price cuts...

The good news is that the [Qin EV, the Dolphin and the Seagull models are expected to be the first BYD electric cars to get versions with a sodium-ion battery](https://cnevpost.com/2022/11/22/byd-to-mass-produce-sodium-ion-batteries-q2-2023-report/) later this year, which will help to cut down the prices easily.

Thanks [Pedro Ventura](https://twitter.com/2_kamikaze_2) for the heads up.

 

What do you think about the Euro version of the BYD Dolphin compared to its main rival, the MG 4 Electric? Are you more interested in the future cheaper version with sodium-ion battery?
