Hozon Auto is now launching the new NETA V Pro as a more affordable alternative to the popular BYD Dolphin.

 

> Positioned as a 70,000-class smart technology cabin, Nezha V has delivered 40,372 units since its launch on November 3, 2020, becoming the top seller of pure electric SUVs among new car companies. With outstanding product highlights such as high-value, high-performance, and high-quality products, Nezha V has been deeply recognized by young consumers, especially in first- and second-tier cities that account for more than 50% of delivery.

 

Let's see some details.

While I was writing this article I noticed that the BYD Dolphin is now listed at MIIT's (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology) website with a new version (BYD7004BEV4) that has a slightly higher range compared to previous versions - increased from 405 to 420 km.

 

Anyway, the NETA V Pro and the BYD Dolphin also have OTA (over-the-air) updates and are packed with safety features that you normally don’t see in a car this price, such as:

- Adaptive Cruise System (ACC)
- Forward Collision Warning (FCW)
- Automatic Emergency Braking system (AEB)
- Lane Departure Warning (LDW)
- Active Lane Keeping (LKS)
- Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR)
- Traffic Jam Assist (TJA)

 

I really like both models, regarding value for money we can't find any better and they have the right dimensions for most people - compact and yet big enough to fit 5 passengers when required. Spec wise they are very similar, but the NETA V Pro is more efficient and the BYD Dolphin has a higher top speed. I hope that Hozon will soon introduce a LFP variant so it can increase production to keep up with the high demand.

If they arrive in Europe with a price similar to the Dacia Spring (below 20.000 euros before subsidies) and don't have long waiting times, they'll be top sellers for sure. Without production constraints both could sell above 100.000 monthly units easily.

What do you think? What's your favorite?
