The Cherry Cat is the first SUV made by ORA and will be available with LFP (LiFePO4) and NMx cobalt-free batteries made by SVOLT for different ranges/prices.

 

The general characteristics of this electric car were [already known](/2021/07/15/ora-cherry-cat-debuts-nmx-battery-from-svolt/) and are listed below.

 

**ORA Cherry Cat (LFP version)**

- **Length**: 4.510 mm
- **Wheelbase**: 2.710 mm
- **Width**: 1.855 mm
- **Height**: 1.665 mm
- **Gross vehicle weight**: 2.230 kg (with passengers and cargo)
- **Curb weight**: 1.800 – 1.855 kg (empty vehicle)
- **Motor**: 66 kW (constant) and 150 kW (peak)
- **Max speed**: 180 km/h
- **Battery**: LFP (LiFePO4) by SVOLT

 

**ORA Cherry Cat (NMx version)**

- **Length**: 4.510 mm
- **Wheelbase**: 2.710 mm
- **Width**: 1.855 mm
- **Height**: 1.665 mm
- **Gross vehicle weight**: 2.260 kg (with passengers and cargo)
- **Curb weight**: 1.885 kg (empty vehicle)
- **Motor**: 66 kW (constant) and 150 kW (peak)
- **Max speed**: 180 km/h
- **Battery**: NMx (LNMO) by SVOLT

 

However, only now we know the characteristics of the different cobalt-free batteries. Let's take a look.

 

**LFP (LiFePO4) battery**

- **Capacity**: 66 kWh (60,5 kWh usable)
- **Weight**: 458 kg
- **Energy density**: 145,1 Wh/kg
- **Range**: 470 km (NEDC) and around 350 km in WLTP

 

**NMx (LNMO) battery**

- **Capacity**: 84 kWh (79,62 kWh usable)
- **Weight**: 487,4 kg
- **Energy density**: 172,3 Wh/kg
- **Range**: 600 km (NEDC) and around 450 km in WLTP

 

I'm a bit disappointed with the energy density of the NMx battery and was expecting at least 200 Wh/kg thanks to a CTP (cell-to-pack) configuration. However, the poor GCTP (gravimetric cell-to-pack) ratio (around 72 %) suggests the usage of modules inside the battery pack.

Hopefully, in the near future SVOLT will make module-less packs with the NMx prismatic battery cells to increase the energy density.

 

Anyway, we still don't know the starting price nor the fast charging rates of the ORA Cherry Cat.
