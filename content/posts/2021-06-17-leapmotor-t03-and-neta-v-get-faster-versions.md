Today I bring good news my fellow readers! The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has just approved faster versions of the Leapmotor T03 and the NETA V to be produced and sold in China.

 

Previously, as it happens with most small electric cars in China, the Leapmotor T03 and the NETA V had their top speeds limited to 100 km/h (capped via firmware). Fortunately, recent MIIT homologation documents show us that these two popular electric cars will have new versions with their top speeds increased.

 

**New top speeds**

- **Leapmotor T03**: 120 km/h with 55 kW motor
- **NETA V**: 121 km/h with 70 kW motor

 

However, we still don't know if these new upcoming versions with higher top speeds will also have longer ranges or not. Nonetheless, higher top speeds will further increase the demand for these already popular electric cars.

Below we have the current specs of both electric cars.

 

**NETA V**

Anyway, I already wrote articles praising both electric cars and think they could have success in most countries. In my opinion, the Leapmotor T03 and the NETA V are likely the electric cars that offer the best value for money today. While affordable, they still deliver decent range (around 300 km in WLTP) and great safety features that are rare in smaller electric cars. They both make the Dacia Spring look bad...

The recent top speed increase might suggest that these electric cars are getting ready to finally leave the comfort of their domestic market and head to more demanding markets, such as Europe, New Zealand or Australia. What do you think?
