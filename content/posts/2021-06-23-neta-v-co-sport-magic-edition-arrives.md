Last week I wrote an article announcing that the NETA V would soon get a faster version in China. That version is now available to order and it's called NETA V Co-sport Magic Edition.

 

Let's see more details about this new edition.

 

**NETA V Co-sport Magic Edition**

- **Length**: 4.070 mm
- **Wheelbase**: 2.420 mm
- **Width**: 1.690 mm
- **Height**: 1.540 mm
- **Tire specifications**: 185/55 R16
- **Wheels**: aluminium
- **Number of seats**: 5
- **Motor**: 70 kW and 150 N.m of torque
- **Maximum speed**: 120 km/h
- **Acceleration performance**: 3,9 seconds (0-50 km/h)
- **DC fast charging**: 30 minutes (30-80 %)
- **On-board charging**: 6-8 h (6,6 kW)
- **Range**: 401 km (NEDC) and around 300 km in WLTP
- **Starting price (before subsidies)**: 86.900 yuan (11.236 euros)
- **Starting price (after subsidies)**: 76.900 yuan (9.943 euros)

 

Curiously, this new edition comes with V2L (Vehicle-to-Load) capability as standard.

 

For the European standards this edition isn't considered sporty. Its acceleration time from 0 to 50 km/h is the same as the new Renault ZOE 50 and the 0 to 100 km/h performance isn't even announced...

However, I think that this electric car is amazing and offers great value for money. This is the kind of electric supermini that many Europeans would love to have.

Its maker, [Hozon Auto already has the official website available in English](https://www.hozonauto.com/en/en-index.html), which suggests that selling outside its domestic market is planned.

 

What do you think?
