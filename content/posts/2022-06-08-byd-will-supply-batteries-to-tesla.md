It's no longer a rumor, BYD will supply batteries to Tesla.

 

Lian Yubo, BYD‘s executive vice president confirmed the deal in an interview to the Chinese TV channel CGTN.

 

> Tesla is a very successful company no matter what, BYD respects Tesla and we admire Tesla.
> 
> We are good friends with Elon Musk, and we will soon supply him with batteries. We are friends.
> 
> It (Tesla) has a high starting point and adopts a high-profile strategy, including in the US capital market.
> 
> It first launched the Model S and Model X, shaping itself into a high-end brand, giving young people the feeling that it is the representative of fashion, innovation and technology.
> 
> Some of our domestic new car makers are actually also learning from it (Tesla), and it is an example for us to learn from.

 

Currently, Tesla Model 3/Y cars made in China have their cobalt-free battery cells supplied by the Chinese giant CATL, but the battery packs aren't very energy dense at 125 Wh/kg. However, [CATL says that by getting rid of modules, their LFP battery packs will be able to reach an energy density of 160 Wh/kg](/2022/03/26/catl-announced-its-third-generation-ctp-battery-technology/) soon.

On the other hand, BYD is already producing 60 kWh module-less battery packs with 150 Wh/kg, that power the long-range version of the [BYD Yuan Plus](/2021/08/17/byd-yuan-plus-is-almost-ready-for-launch/). Such battery pack would be perfect for a smaller and more affordable Tesla hatchback for the global market.

Anyway, the competition to supply the largest all-electric carmaker with cobalt-free battery cells will be fierce. [SVOLT](/2022/03/28/svolt-reached-200-wh-kg-with-lfp-battery-cells/) with its own short-blade version of energy dense cobalt-free battery cells is the underdog that might surprise many people.

Battery cell makers and carmakers that still don't acknowledge the importance of module-less and cobalt-free battery packs to mass produce affordable electric cars have a tough road ahead...
