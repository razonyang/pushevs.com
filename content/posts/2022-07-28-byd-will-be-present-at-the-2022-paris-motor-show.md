BYD will go the 2022 Paris Motor Show to announce that the EV revolution is coming to Europe.

 

> BYD, the world’s leading manufacturer of new energy vehicles (NEVs) and power batteries, will attend the Paris Motor Show 2022 to showcase its latest passenger car product range and technologies to the European automotive audience. It follows BYD’s recent announcement to enter Europe with its technologically advanced range of new energy passenger vehicles, **starting with delivery in Q4 2022**, and its ongoing commitment to this emerging European market.
> 
> Norway has served as an effective pilot market in Northern Europe for BYD. In 2021, BYD successfully launched its Tang SUV to Norwegian customers and has since received positive feedback from consumers. Following this, BYD has recently appointed key dealer partners in Europe to continue this journey. Through such partnerships, BYD is now poised to enter the wider European market as it exhibits its latest range of new energy passenger vehicles and industry innovations from a prime location at the Paris Motor Show.
> 
> Such automotive innovations emerge from BYD’s long-established expertise in power battery research and development spanning 30 years, and ground-breaking accomplishments in world-leading technology for eMobility solutions. This knowledge and dedication to battery electric vehicle development has been a major factor in BYD becoming the world’s leading NEV manufacturer, with products for commercial and private use. BYD has provided its NEV service to over 2.1 million customers, and in the first half of 2022, reached a milestone for sales of new energy passenger cars exceeding 640,000 units.
> 
> BYD stands by its long-held vision for electrification in transportation. BYD is committed to developing and evolving sustainable technology to reduce global carbon emissions, providing non-polluting viable alternatives to ICE vehicles. BYD also believes in the value of regional partnerships in helping to accelerate change, and provide customers with local comprehensive product support.
> 
> BYD has a long heritage in the global NEV sector, with extensive experience in the industry. The first time BYD attended a European automotive show was at the Geneva Motor Show in 2008, when the world’s first PHEV F3DM was researched, developed and unveiled by BYD. Now 14 years later, BYD has chosen the Paris Motor Show to underline its commitment to bringing a range of new energy passenger vehicles to customers in Europe.
> 
> Michael Shu, General Manager and Managing Director, BYD Europe and International Cooperation Division: “We are excited to bring the BYD brand, and our latest passenger car innovations equipped with world-leading technology to customers in Europe. We are looking forward to developing relationships with European dealer partners at this momentous time to bring customers innovative, sustainable solutions and localised comprehensive support, from sales to aftersales services. To be part of this prestigious international event for the automotive industry provides the perfect launchpad for us to showcase our eMobility solutions in Europe. It also underpins our commitment to sustainability in this sector, in line with our support for the Cool the Earth by 1℃ global initiative.”

 

In Europe, BYD is already very successful in producing and selling electric buses, now it's time for the Chinese company do the same with its passenger electric cars.

Considering that last year BYD confirmed that it'll produce batteries for electric cars in Europe, I expect that at the Paris Motor Show the company reveals its plans for localized production.
