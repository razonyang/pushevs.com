Currently the most popular electric car from SGMW (SAIC-GM-Wuling) is definitely the Wuling Hong Guang MINI EV, as you may have noticed from multiple articles I wrote. However, the reality is that this is a very spartan electric car without basic safety features required by European or North American standards.

The much better equipped electric cars Baojun E300 (two-seater) and Baojun E300 Plus (four-seater) also built by SGMW have much better chances to become world-class affordable electric cars.

 

Let's see the specs.

**Baojun E300 Plus specs**

- **On-board charger**: 6,6 kW (5 hours to charge)
- **DC fast charging**: 30-80 % in 1 hour
- **Turning radius**: 4 meters (rear-wheel drive)
- **Starting price**: between 69.800 and 84.800 yuan (8.920 and 10.836 euros)

 

The most interesting variant is definitely the longer E300 Plus, because when needed the two extra seats can be folded down to give some luggage space.

In their top-spec trim level both the Baojun E300 and E300 Plus are extremely well equipped with modern safety features rare in small and affordable cars, such as:

- Adaptive Cruise Control
- Lane Departure Warning & Assist System
- Intelligent Safety Protection
- Automatic Emergency Braking System
- Auxiliary and Valet Parking System
- Guided Vehicle Anti-theft Warning System

 

As for the battery, the cobalt-free LFP battery cells are provided by [Great Power](http://www.greatpower.net/) and the pack (320 V - 100 Ah) seems to have a 100s1p cell disposition (100 cells all connect in series, none in parallel).

The 305 km range in NEDC represents around 229 km (3/4) in WLTP, enough to make this electric car acceptable for many European customers if sold here for a decent price. However, the top speed would need to be increased to 120 km/h.

 

Anyway, the Baojun E300 Plus looks like a futuristic autonomous electric car from a Sci-Fi movie and you either love it or hate it. Since I'm a Sci-Fi fan I love it...

This one and the [Leapmotor T03](/2020/08/03/leapmotor-t03-great-small-electric-car/) are definitely the most interesting Chinese electric cars in the A-segment that could be successful in Europe. The Leapmotor T03 with its NCM 811 battery has higher range, but the Baojun E300 Plus with its cobalt-free battery can be cheaper and produced in much higher numbers.

What do you think about this A-segment electric car? Would it be a nice alternative to the Renault Twingo ZE or the FIAT 500 Action in Europe if it had a short delivery time and sold for around 15.000 euros before government incentives?
