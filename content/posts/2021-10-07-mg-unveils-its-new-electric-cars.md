Today MG unveiled its new all-electric model range, comprised by the electric station wagon MG5, its flagship SUV Marvel R Electric and a renewed MG ZS EV.

 

Let's see the press release.

 

> ## All-new MG Marvel R Electric
> 
> Unveiled last March, the MG Marvel R Electric is the brand’s flagship SUV, fitted for European motorists who appreciate design, technology and performance. The largest and most luxurious SUV in MG’s portfolio offers a spacious interior with great attention to refinement, quality and technology. Particularly striking is the 19.4” central touchscreen to operate the all-new MG iSMART connectivity system with an extensive range of (online) functions and connection through a smartphone app, with which various functions can be controlled remotely.
> 
> Depending on the market, customers can choose from three trim levels (Comfort, Luxury and Performance) and two advanced powertrain variants (RWD and AWD). The Comfort and Luxury both have rear-wheel drive, two electric motors, a system output of 132 kW (180 ps), 410 Nm of torque, and a WLTP range of 402 kilometres. The Performance version adds an electric motor to the front axle, and offers permanent all-wheel drive. System output and peak torque are set at 212 kW (288 ps) and 665 Nm, combined with a range of 370 kilometres (WLTP).
> 
> All versions of the Marvel R Electric are equipped with a 70 kWh battery and 11 kW 3-phase on-board charger for quick AC-charging. The battery is also suitable for fast charging (DC) with a maximum of 92 kW, which allows the battery to be charged from 5-80% in just 43 minutes. Furthermore, the standard equipment of the Marvel R Electric includes a comprehensive range of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), a heat pump that can heat or cool the battery (and the interior) to ensure optimum charging performance in all circumstances and a so-called V2L (vehicle-to-load) system. This striking feature allows the battery to supply energy to an external electrical system, for example an air pump, electric scooter, a laptop or even another BEV.
> 
> The new MG Marvel R Electric will be available in the European MG Brand Stores from the end of this month. The European prices\* start at € 39,990 for the Comfort version. For the additional cost of just € 4,000, the SUV is available in Luxury trim (€ 43,990). The most comprehensive and powerful version, the Performance, is available from € 47,990.

>  
> 
> ## Renewed MG ZS EV: new design, more range and faster charging
> 
> Another newcomer from MG to be launched this month, is the renewed MG ZS EV. It’s the thoroughly updated version of MG’s first model in mainland Europe that immediately attracted attention as the first truly affordable all-electric SUV in the B-segment. It’s not without reason that the ZS EV already pleased more than 15,000 customers in its first year of sales, with which the model reached top positions in the UK, Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands and France.
> 
> Still, MG engineers saw room for improvement to offer customers a longer range and ease of use. The renewed MG ZS EV is characterized by a modernized design, improved performance, a significantly longer range and even more technology.
> 
> The ZS EV will be offered with a choice of two trim levels (Comfort and Luxury) and two battery variants. The 70 kWh Long Range battery will be available right from the market launch, offering a range of 440 km (WLTP) compared to 263 km for the current ZS EV. At a later stage, a 50,3 kWh Standard Range battery with 320 km (WLTP) range will be available as well. In addition to the increased battery capacity, the new MG ZS EV can also charge faster. The Long Range version is equipped with an 11 kW 3-phase on-board as standard.
> 
> Furthermore, like the Marvel R Electric, every MG ZS EV is featured with the newly developed MG iSMART connectivity system, which also offers a connection through a smartphone app, with which various functions can be controlled remotely.
> 
> The renewed MG ZS EV will arrive at the European MG Brand Stores by the end of this month. Prices\* start at € 30,990 for the Standard Range battery. The ZS EV with Long Range battery is available from € 34,990.
>

> 
> ## New MG5 Electric: the world’s first all-electric station wagon
> 
> Current developments in the BEV-segment make it clear that many new electric models are being released in the more expensive premium class. Meanwhile, there is an increasing demand for modern, safe and practical electric cars that are especially accessible for the general public.
> 
> The new MG5 Electric is the perfect answer. It’s the world’s first all-electric station wagon with a spacious, practical and functional interior. With a generous 479 litres of luggage space that can be expanded to nearly 1,400 litres with the rear seats folded down, the MG5 Electric offers plenty of usability. Also, like the Marvel R Electric and ZS EV, the MG5 Electric will be offered with the MG iSMART connectivity system including the smartphone app as standard. The front wheels are driven by an electric motor which produces 115 kW (156 ps) and 260 Nm of torque. The MG5 Electric is initially offered with a 61,1 kWh battery and a range of 400 km (WLTP). At a later stage, a version with a 50,3 kWh battery will be offered as well, which provides a WLTP range of 320 km. Both battery versions of the all-electric station wagon will offer quick charging capability (AC) due to the 11 kW 3-phase on-board charger.
> 
> The MG5 Electric will arrive at the MG Brand Stores in the first quarter of 2022, with a choice of two trim levels (Comfort and Luxury) and prices\* starting under € 30,000. More details about the MG5 Electric including all prices will be released in the run-up to the market launch.

**Renewed MG ZS EV (standard range version)**

- **Range**: 320 km (WLTP)
- **Battery capacity**: 50,3 kWh
- **On-board charger**: 11 kW (3-phase) is optional
- **Fast charging**: 30-80 % in 30 minutes

Summing up, the biggest surprise was the renewed MG ZS EV with faster charging, more range and better efficiency for a similar price. It also looks much nicer now without the fake grill of the previous model...

Notice that the new entry-level model got its battery capacity increased by 13 % (from 44,5 to 50,3 kWh), while its WLTP range increased by 22 % (from 263 to 320 km). Showing that the new model is much more efficient. I just think that its starting price should be lower, since the Renault ZOE offers better range and efficiency for a similar price - after dealer discounts.

As for the other two models, while I think that the Marvel R Electric looks amazing, its efficiency is very poor, just compare it with the Kia e-Niro for example... Regarding the MG5 Electric station wagon, it seems to be an unique and winning product in its segment, with decent price, range and efficiency - at least until better alternatives arrive from competitors.

 

Lastly, by introducing a new generation of electric cars still based on 400-volt powertrains in late 2021, I think that MG missed a big opportunity to establish itself as an advanced electric car brand and it's now only catching up... At least, its flagship SUV Marvel R Electric should have arrived with a 800-volt system.

By next year, thanks to silicon and graphene based batteries combined with 800-volt systems, 3-6 C fast charging rates will start to become more common in electric cars. In a year or two, electric cars that take more than 20 minutes to charge 80 % of their batteries - at a fast charging station - will be considered old generation.
