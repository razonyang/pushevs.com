Guoxuan is a Chinese battery cell maker known for producing the most energy-dense cobalt-free LFP (LiFePO4) battery cells.

Late last year this manufacturer reached a record-breaking energy density of 212 Wh/kg for a LFP battery cell, made with a LFP cathode and a silicon anode. Now, Guoxuan is providing more details about this pouch battery cell.

 

**Battery cell specs**

- **Capacity**: 55 Ah
- **Voltage**: 3,2 V
- **Energy**: 176 Wh
- **Weight**: 830 g
- **Energy density**: 212 Wh/kg

 

Moreover, Guoxuan has the goal of reaching 230 Wh/kg already during this year and 260 Wh/kg in 2022.

 

**Guoxuan's LFP battery cell evolution**

- **2009**: 95 Wh/kg
- **2015**: 140 Wh/kg
- **2019**: 190 Wh/kg
- **2020**: 212 Wh/kg (191 Wh/kg at pack level with JTM)
- **2021**: 230 Wh/kg (207 Wh/kg at pack level with JTM)
- **2022**: 260 Wh/kg (234 Wh/kg at pack level with JTM)

Being an inherently safe battery chemistry, battery packs made with LFP (LiFePO4) cells don't require much safety equipment, such as metal firewalls between cells or a complex TMS (Thermal Management System). This means that the GCTPR (gravimetric cell-to-pack ratio) for this battery chemistry is higher than what we have with NCM or NCA battery packs.

Guoxuan uses the JTM (Jelly roll-to-module) technology to achieve a record-breaking GCTPR of 90 %.

 

Let's see what kind of battery packs can we have with the battery cell recently unveiled by Guoxuan.

 

**Hypothetical battery pack 1**

- **Configuration**: 136s1p
- **Energy**: 23,9 kWh
- **Weight (cells)**: 113 kg
- **Weight (pack)**: 125 kg (estimated from a GCTPR of 90 %)
- **Cost**: 1.915 euros (estimated with 80 euros per kWh)

 

**Hypothetical battery pack 2**

- **Configuration**: 136s2p
- **Energy**: 47,9 kWh
- **Weight (cells)**: 226 kg
- **Weight (pack)**: 251 kg (estimated from a GCTPR of 90 %)
- **Cost**: 3.830 euros (estimated with 80 euros per kWh)

 

**Hypothetical battery pack 3**

- **Configuration**: 136s3p
- **Energy**: 71,8 kWh
- **Weight (cells)**: 339 kg
- **Weight (pack)**: 376 kg (estimated from a GCTPR of 90 %)
- **Cost**: 5.745 euros (estimated with 80 euros per kWh)

 

Considering that Volkswagen is the biggest stakeholder of Guoxuan, we might see the German automaker adopting this technology soon.
