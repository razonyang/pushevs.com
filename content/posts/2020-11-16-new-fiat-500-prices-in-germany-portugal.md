Anyway, the cheapest variant (Action) seems aimed to be an alternative to the Renault Twingo ZE, while the other more expensive variants seem aimed to be alternatives to the BMW i3. If the waiting time isn't very long, the new FIAT 500 can be a successful electric car in Europe.

I wonder if FIAT will offer as good discounts as Renault does for its electric cars. What do you think?
