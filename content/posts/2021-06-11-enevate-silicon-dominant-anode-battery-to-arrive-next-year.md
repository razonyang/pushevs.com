Enevate wants to enable electric vehicles to charge as fast as refueling gas cars and is now closer to make it happen.

This Californian company just announced a new production license agreement with the South Korean battery cell maker EnerTech International to commercialize Enevate’s silicon-dominant anode battery technology.

Commercialization is scheduled for 2022 and pre-production batteries have already been built and tested by Enertech’s existing lithium-ion battery manufacturing equipment.

> Enevate uses an innovative, multi-layer design that allows us to safely pack more energy into a single cell, because our XFC-EnergyTM silicon-dominant anode layer requires a fraction of the space of a graphite anode layer used in a conventional cell. In fact, large-format EV size cells achieve over 1000 Wh/L and 350 Wh/kg energy density.

Anyway, I doubt that the small South Korean company EnerTech International will mass produce this battery technology. I think that Enevate will use EnerTech's equipment to produce multiple sample units and prove that the technology is ready for mass production, then LG Chem - that is also an investor of Enevate - should step up and get the license to mass produce it.

 

Now let's forget Enevate for a moment and talk about silicon anodes in general and their importance in EV batteries.

 

Batteries with silicon anodes are revolutionary, especially when we consider that this battery technology can also be applied to cobalt-free batteries, such as LFP (LiFePO4). This was already [demonstrated by Guoxuan](/2021/01/10/guoxuan-unveils-a-cobalt-free-lfp-pouch-battery-cell-with-212-wh-kg/) early this year.

 

The possibility of charging 75 % of an EV battery in 5 minutes with a C-rate of 10 C is really impressive. Extremely fast charging is essential to make electric vehicles mainstream, since it allows them to have smaller and lighter batteries, yet still remain useful in everyday life.

Considering the examples below, which hypothetical electric car would you prefer? A or B?

 

**Electric car A**

- **Range**: 300 km (WLTP)
- **Battery capacity**: 40 kWh
- **Consumption**: 14 kWh/100 km (charging losses included)
- **Weight**: 1.200 kg
- **Fast charging**: 75 % in 5 minutes
- **Price**: 15.000 euros

 

**Electric car B**

- **Range**: 550 km (WLTP)
- **Battery capacity**: 80 kWh
- **Consumption**: 16 kWh/100 km (charging losses included)
- **Weight**: 1.450 kg
- **Fast charging**: 80 % in 30 minutes
- **Price**: 22.000 euros

 

I know I would prefer the cheaper and more efficient option A. Lower weight also means faster acceleration and shorter stopping distance, improving safety.

 

I really dislike when automakers complain that EV batteries are expensive but then show us that they don't care about getting the most from their batteries. Their solution to increase the range of their electric cars is almost always to add more battery capacity, instead of improving efficiency first (just look at Volvo electric cars...).

Before thinking to introduce heavy 100 kWh batteries in electric cars, we should have more efficient electric cars that also charge faster. Adding more battery capacity to get more range should always be the last resort, especially if we believe automakers' narrative that batteries are extremely expensive... (You know I don't!)

 

Finally, it's becoming obvious that the ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) age is near the end. Technologies such as CTP (cell-to-pack), cobalt-free (or low-cobalt content) cathodes and silicon anodes make electric vehicles better than their gas counterparts in every single way.

Moreover, while ICE vehicles have already maxed out their potential, the potential of electric vehicles to become even better is enormous. Solar roofs, V2G (vehicle to grid) and V2L (vehicle to load) are some technologies that'll soon become standard in EVs. How cool is that you will be able to use your electric car as a mobile power bank that can be charged with solar energy?

 

Some examples where large mobile power banks can be useful...

- Vacation house in a remote area without access to the electrical grid
- Construction work in remote communities
- Farmers' market
- Music festivals
- Camping
- Emergencies during a power outage
- Charging other EV

 

I'm sure that you can think in a lot more uses for a big mobile power bank...

Honestly, when I look to current mainstream EVs I tend to think they are still a bit primitive, considering their true potential. They could already be so much better...

 

Thanks for the heads up Rok.
