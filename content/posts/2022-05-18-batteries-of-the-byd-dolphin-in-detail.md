Thanks to the efficient TMS (thermal management system) of the BYD e-platform 3.0, the battery packs are kept at optimal temperature.

 

Anyway, the BYD Dolphin and the BYD Yuan Plus were the first electric cars made on the new BYD e-platform 3.0, however the battery packs are not 800-volt. The first BYD electric car to have a 800-volt battery pack will be the upcoming BYD Seal, which will be available with 61,44 and 82,56 kWh batteries.

BYD electric cars made on the BYD e-platform 3.0 will become global cars and sold in most important markets.
