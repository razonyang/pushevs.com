SOL or Sihao in Chinese is a car brand launched by JAC-Volkswagen's joint venture for affordable electric cars. Volkswagen originally planned to call the brand SEAT, but the Chinese government didn’t allow it. After some deliberations they decided to go with SOL, which means sun in Spanish (also in Portuguese).

 

SOL recently unveiled three new electric cars, the E10X, E20X and E40X at the Guangzhou Auto Show.

 

> Sihao is one of the thirteen brands of Volkswagen. Since June 2020, the strategic joint venture between Volkswagen Group and Jianghuai Automobile Group has been fully launched. After Volkswagen has acquired 50% of the shares of Jianghuai Automobile Group, it has followed Volkswagen Global Electric The development of new energy products, channel construction, and brand promotion of Sihao New Energy have been accelerated.

> At the Guangzhou International Auto Show, A0-class product Sihao E20X, A-class product Sihao E40X and A00-class product E10X will all be on the stage. Among them, Si Hao E10X is the first public appearance, the German Bauhaus design style, in the same line as the Volkswagen iD series, simple and applicable ergonomics, rich intelligent experience, dazzling color matching, fashionable Q cute, can be called "A00 the most beautiful and pure "Electric crossover" has countless fans. Coupled with Volkswagen's strong empowerment in R&D, manufacturing, quality management, etc., the product strength is beyond doubt!

 

The most interesting of the bunch is the small SOL E10X, which is a restyled version of the JAC iEV6E and will be launched in March next year.

Anyway, the JAC Sihao E10X with its super safe and affordable cobalt-free LFP battery would be a perfect replacement for the VW triplets in Europe. Volkswagen would just need to increase its maximum speed and relabel it as SEAT E10X.

Unfortunately, Volkswagen's roadmap shows that it plans to introduce a proper replacement for the electric triplets only in 2025...
