It looks nice and the specs are good, especially the charging capabilities. The 22 kW on-board charger is something that should be standard by now for all electric cars sold in Europe. It also has a frunk and a HUD (Head Up Display) - that are still rare in most cars.

However, the smart #1 is not as efficient as the Hyundai Kona Electric and it has also less range.

 

Nonetheless, it will be price and availability that will dictate its success. I would be more confident in this department if it had a LFP (LiFePO4) battery instead of NCM.

Anyway, we should know more about price and availability very soon.
