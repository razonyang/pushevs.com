Hyundai Motor just deleted a press release where it informed that the new model year Hyundai Kona Electric is going to get a 11 kW on-charger in Europe.

Fortunately Stefan Kopeinig saved a screenshot with the important information from the deleted press release.

Besides the new 3-phase 11 kW on-board charger, the new Hyundai Kona Electric also gets the new Hyundai Blue Link app, optional new centre display touch-screen and heated rear seats.

In Europe, 11 kW on-board chargers should be standard by now, with an additional charger in parallel to reach 22 kW as an option. [LG Chem is already producing 11 kW on-board chargers](/2018/06/11/new-lg-chem-on-board-chargers-up-to-11-kw/) - aimed to the European market - with an impressive energy efficiency of 95 %.

Anyway, the deliveries of the new upgraded Hyundai Kona Electric will begin in European markets in late 2019.
