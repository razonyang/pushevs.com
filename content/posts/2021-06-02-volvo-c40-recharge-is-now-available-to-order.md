Made in Belgium, the Volvo C40 Recharge is now available to order in Europe.

 

> Volvo Cars has officially opened order books for the C40 Recharge, the company’s latest fully electric model.
> 
> A landmark car for the company’s recently announced new commercial strategy, the C40 Recharge is available online via volvocars.com in markets across Europe\* as of this week. Customers can order from the comfort of their own home or place an online order together with their retailer.
> 
> In line with its ambition of reducing complexity in its model portfolio and focus on attractive pre-selected variants, Volvo Cars has drastically simplified the consumer offering of the C40 Recharge.
> 
> When customers get a new C40 Recharge, it will come with a convenient Care offer including items such as service, warranty, roadside assistance, as well as insurance and home charging options where available.
> 
> The C40 Recharge is the latest manifestation of Volvo Cars’ commitment to a zero-emission future. The company will roll out several additional electric models in coming years and aims for 50 per cent of its global sales volume to consist of fully electric cars by 2025. By 2030, it plans for every car it sells to be pure electric.
> 
> The C40 Recharge has all the benefits of an SUV but with a lower and sleeker design. The rear of the C40 Recharge features a striking rear-end design to go with the lower roof line, while the new front design introduces a new face for electric Volvos and includes headlights with state-of-the-art pixel technology.
> 
> Inside, the C40 Recharge provides customers with the high seating position that most Volvo drivers prefer, while it is available with a range of colour and deco options unique to the model. It is also the first Volvo model to be completely leather-free.
> 
> Like the XC40 Recharge, the C40 Recharge comes with one of the best infotainment systems on the market, jointly developed with Google and based on the Android operating system. It provides consumers with Google apps and services built-in, such as Google Assistant, Google Maps and Google Play.
> 
> Unlimited data enables superior connectivity and the C40 Recharge is designed to receive software updates over the air. That means it will continue to improve over time after it has left the factory.
> 
> The propulsion consists of twin electric motors, one on the front and one on the rear axle, powered by a 78kWh battery that can be fast-charged to 80 per cent in about 40 minutes. It offers an anticipated range of around 420 km, which is expected to improve over time via over-the-air software updates.
> 
> The C40 Recharge will go into production this fall and will be built alongside the XC40 Recharge at the Volvo Cars manufacturing plant in Ghent, Belgium.

Anyway, I'm not impressed by Volvo electric cars. Just because electricity is cheap it doesn't mean that efficiency doesn't matter in electric vehicles.

A 420 km WLTP range from a 78 kWh battery suggests that the Volvo C40 Recharge isn't very efficient... even if Volvo says that it can be improved over time via OTA (over-the-air) firmware updates.

For example, the [Kia EV6 gets a WLTP range above 510 km from a 77,4 kWh battery](https://www.kia.com/ie/new-cars/ev6/discover/).

What do you think?
