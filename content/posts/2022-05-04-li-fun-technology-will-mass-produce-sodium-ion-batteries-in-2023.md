Li-FUN Technology recently announced that it will produce the first generation of sodium-ion battery cells later this year in June. The mass production is scheduled for 2023.

 

Let's see some details.

 

**First generation sodium-ion battery cell (prototype)**

- **Gravimetric energy density**: 140 Wh/kg
- **Volumetric energy density**: 240 Wh/L
- **Cycle life**: above 4.000 cycles
- **Fast charging**: 80 % in 15 minutes
- **Capacity retention at -20º C**: 88 % at 3 C-rate
- **Format**: pouch
- **Start of production**: June, 2022

 

**Second generation sodium-ion battery cell (mass production)**

- **Gravimetric energy density**: 160 Wh/kg
- **Volumetric energy density**: 280 Wh/L
- **Cycle life**: above 4.000 cycles
- **Fast charging**: 80 % in 15 minutes
- **Capacity retention at -20º C**: 88 % at 3 C-rate
- **Format**: pouch
- **Start of production**: 2023

 

These sodium-ion battery cells will have great over-discharge resistance and can recover from deep discharges to 0 volts. As for over-charge resistance, if they reach 4 volts, half of the capacity will be lost.

Li-FUN Technology expects to produce sodium-ion batteries mostly for low-cost electric cars, electric buses and energy storage systems (ESS).

 

Anyway, it's clear that this battery maker is mimicking CATL, who also aims to start producing sodium-ion battery cells with similar specs and in the same time frame. However, CATL will probably remain with the prismatic format, instead of pouch.

While with mass-produced module-less LFP (LiFePO4) battery packs we can already reach a kWh cost around 60 euros, with sodium-ion the kWh drops to below 40 euros. With these two battery technologies it's possible to produce electric cars cheaper than their gas-counterparts.

Imagine an electric supermini like the Renault ZOE sold for the same price as its gas-counterpart (Clio) - without the need of subsidies -, with a 40 kWh sodium-ion CTP (cell-to-pack) battery that could be charged in 15 minutes and last beyond the vehicle life cycle...
