One of the best alternatives to the Wuling Hong Guang MINI EV currently available is the Changan Benben E-Star, that recently became even cheaper with the introduction of the [National Edition](/2021/05/20/changan-benben-e-star-gets-new-low-cost-edition/).

As for Tesla, considering that it sells much more expensive electric cars, its sales figures are impressive. Furthermore, if the introduction of a cheaper Tesla Model Y version with a LFP battery gets confirmed as expected, sales will likely skyrocket.
