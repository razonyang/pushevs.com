Renault finally renewed its all-electric LCV (light commercial vehicle) lineup with faster charging and more range.

 

Let's see some details of the two improved electric vehicles.

 

**Renault Kangoo E-TECH**

- **Motor**: 90 kW
- **Battery capacity**: 45 kWh
- **TMS**: liquid cooling on the versions with the 22 kW charger
- **Battery warranty**: 8 years or 160.000 km (70 % of SoH)
- **Range**: 300 km (WLTP)
- **Regenerative braking regimes**: Sailing (display light B1), Drive (B2) and Brake (B3)
- **On-board charger**: 11 kW (standard) or 22 kW (optional)
- **Fast charging**: 80 kW (optional)

 

Comes standard with a heat pump that "provides optimal performance when the temperature is between -15 and +15°C."

 

**Renault Master E-TECH**

- **Motor**: 57 kW
- **Battery capacity**: 52 kWh
- **Range**: 200 km (WLTP)
- **On-board charger**: 7,4 kW
- **Fast charging**: 22 kW (optional)

 

Some safety features included:

- Front Park Assist
- Rear Park Assist
- Rear Camera
- Rear View Assist with a camera display on the upper section of the windscreen providing an optimal mid and long-range rear view
- Side Wind Assist (standard) that activates above 70 km/h and corrects of up to 50 % of the vehicle's lateral deviation in extreme driving conditions
- Automatic Lights and Wipers (standard)
- Active Emergency Braking System (AEBS), active on city roads and highways
- Lane Departure Warning

 

The Renault Kangoo E-TECH seems to be the most balanced vehicle of the two and the Renault Master E-TECH feels a bit underwhelming. If the Renault Master E-TECH had better specs, it could be transformed into a good camper van and compete with the Volkswagen ID. Buzz. What do you think Renault, about introducing an improved camper variant in this vehicle?

With its large roof, the Renault Master E-TECH could have a solar panel around 500 W installed, wouldn't it be cool? Maybe in the next generation...
