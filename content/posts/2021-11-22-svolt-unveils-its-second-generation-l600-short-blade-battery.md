Right now SVOLT seems to be the only major battery cell maker that aims to provide a good alternative to the popular BYD Blade Battery, by introducing its own long prismatic cobalt-free battery cells to be used in simple module-less battery packs.

 

The prototype of the second generation SVOLT L600 short blade battery cell has the following specs:

 

- **Model**: L600 (second gen)
- **Capacity**: 196 Ah (first generation was 184 Ah)
- **Voltage**: 3,2 V
- **Energy**: 627,2 Wh
- **Gravimetric energy density**: 185 Wh/kg
- **Volumetric energy density**: 430 Wh/L
- **Chemistry**: LFP (LiFePO4)
- **Start of production**: Q3 2022

 

By adopting a 100s1p configuration (100 cells in series), battery packs would have a capacity of 62,72 kWh. I think that 60 kWh is the sweet spot for affordable mainstream electric cars.

 

Considering a GCTP (gravimetric cell-to-pack) ratio of 90 %, the gravimetric energy density of a module-less battery pack should be around 176 Wh/kg.

Considering a VCTP (volumetric cell-to-pack) ratio of 60 %, the volumetric energy density of a module-less battery pack should be around 258 Wh/L.

 

Right now, the BYD Blade Battery only reaches 150 Wh/kg at the pack level.

 

While the current L600 battery cell prototype reaches 185 Wh/kg, SVOLT aims to reach 200 Wh/kg already next year, as we can see in the roadmap below. Therefore, the second-generation L600 battery cell could be more energy dense by the time it enters into production in Q3 2022.

Now imagine how popular would be a super-mini like the Renault ZOE with a 60 kWh LFP battery if sold for the same price of a Clio, without needing any government subsidies. Unfortunately Renault's latest strategy is to focus on NCM battery chemistry alone.

Fortunately, SVOLT already signed battery supply contracts with another European carmaker (Stellantis), so the next generation of the Peugeot e-208, might get such battery pack in a not so distant future.

 

If I was in charge of SVOLT I would try to put a 55-60 kWh battery in a BYD Dolphin just to show off the superiority of my battery technology...

Anyway, by next year BYD will probably release a more energy dense BYD Blade battery, so it can remain the best battery pack available for electric cars.
