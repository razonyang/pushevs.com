### The purpose

I started this website with the purpose of pushing electric vehicles forward, by trying my best to keep the reader informed about what is possible now and destroy some myths about electric cars. They can be affordable, fast and have long range with current technology if automakers get serious about them.

 

### Why?

My interest in electric transportation is mostly political. I’m tired of coups and wars for oil. My expectation is that the adoption of electric transportation will be a factor for peace and democracy all over the world.

 

### The focus

I like to focus on battery technologies and public policies. The articles I write reflect my personal views. It's a mistake to consider that someone writing news can be neutral, since he or she chooses what, when and how to write (social construction of news). I also tend to give a more European perspective to my articles since I'm Portuguese, but feel free to contradict me and share your perspective in the comment section, I welcome constructive discussion.

However, as much as I like electric cars, they are just a small part of my interests. This means I won’t write articles everyday. Instead I’ll focus on topics that other websites don't cover as much or at least I'll try to give you a different perspective on the subjects.

To keep updated you can subscribe to push notifications on your browser by clicking the red bell in the bottom left. This way your browser will notify you every time there's a new article. If you no longer want to receive notifications just click the red bell again to unsubscribe. Push notifications require less work from me to maintain than a newsletter - that some readers frequently ask for.

Some North Americans might find strange, but I use the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) and its general rules in my articles.

 

### How to support this project?

First, you can share your insights in the comment section. Knowledge grows when shared...

Second, if you think the articles are interesting to other people you can share them.

Third, you can check the stores section on the top bar that has affiliate links, if you click on them and buy something, I might get a small commission. It doesn’t cost you extra and helps me.

Welcome aboard,
